# Project Background
This project simulates the design and implementation of a data warehouse and analytical system for an airline, using “Vietnam Airlines” as a sample case to illustrate concepts and workflows.
# Disclaimer 
The dataset used in this project is entirely AI-generated for educational purposes. It does not represent real operational data, and the airline name mentioned is used solely as an example with no affiliation to any actual organisation.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Category 1: Ticket Sales Channels** 
- **Category 2: Pilot Promotion Criteria** 
- **Category 3: Promotional Program Effectiveness**

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The project’s main database structure, shown below, consists of fourteen tables: DIM_THOIGIAN, DIM_KENHBANVE, DIM_TACVU, DIM_PHIHANHDOAN, DIM_KHACHHANG, DIM_MAYBAY, DIM_SANBAY, DIM_TUYENBAY, DIM_KHUYENMAI, DIM_CHUYENBAY, FACT_DATCHO, FACT_CSKH, FACT_THONGTINCHUYENBAY, and FACT_TIEPTHI. A description of each table is as follows:
- **Table 1: DIM_THOIGIAN – Contains date-related attributes from 2022 to 2024 (day, week, month, quarter, year) to enable time-based analysis**
- **Table 2: DIM_KENHBANVE – Stores ticket sales channels and fare classes (e.g., website, app, agents; Economy, Business, First Class) for tracking sales performance by channel and fare type**
- **Table 3: DIM_TACVU – Lists task categories and details for customer service or operational support activities**
- **Table 4: DIM_PHIHANHDOAN – Holds crew member information (name, gender, role, start date, address, birth date, phone number) for managing and analyzing flight crew performance and promotions**
- **Table 5: DIM_KHACHHANG – Stores passenger details (ID, name, gender, nationality, birth date, contact info) for customer analysis**
- **Table 6: DIM_MAYBAY – Records aircraft details (type, manufacturer, seating capacity) to plan fleet utilization and route assignments**
- **Table 7: DIM_SANBAY – Contains airport information (code, name, city, country) for route and network analysis**
- **Table 9: DIM_KHUYENMAI – Stores promotional campaign details (name, discount rate, points required, start/end dates) for marketing analysis**
- **Table 10: DIM_CHUYENBAY – Contains individual flight details (flight code, aircraft, route, origin/destination airports) for scheduling and performance tracking**
- **Table 11: FACT_DATCHO – Records booking transactions (customer, channel, flight, date, seat, fare, discount, final price) for sales and revenue analysis**
- **Table 12: FACT_CSKH – Logs customer service interactions (customer, flight, date, channel, task, staff member, priority level) for service performance evaluation**
- **Table 13: FACT_THONGTINCHUYENBAY – Tracks operational flight data (crew IDs, time, empty seats, crew flight hours) for performance and resource management**
- **Table 14: FACT_TIEPTHI – Records promotional program participation (customer, campaign, points earned/redeemed, flight, date) for evaluating marketing effectiveness**

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
